if i could float away, 
dive from abyss to sunshine

would i finally reach the warm seaside,
or get chopped up to little pieces,
and have my heart put aside?

it's scary...
but i can't stay in cold tench.
memories of twilight remind me of lost warm embrace,
caves without solution,
ponds hollow of hope,
endless midnight.

but if i could float away,
would i give up half way?
